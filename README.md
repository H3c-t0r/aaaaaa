# mojoportal
mojoPortal is a website framework built on the older ASP.NET WebForms framework for .NET 4.5

mojoPortal was under active development from August 2004 until late 2014 but it is no longer under active development. I am continuing to maintain it with security fixes if such issues come up, and occasionally bug fixes. 

I put in many years of time effort and money trying to build a business selling a few add on features for mojoPortal, but never really made a living on it and now it has declined in popularity to a point where it is no longer a worthwhile venture for me to spend time working on it. Many people now consider the ASP.NET WebForms platform as old fashioned and out of date. There is a much better way of doing things with modern patterns going forward with the new ASP.NET Core framework, and that is the technology I want to be working with going forward.

Pull requests are welcome for bug fixes.

Feel free to fork it and modify mojoPortal code for your needs or to continue active development yourself on your own fork.
